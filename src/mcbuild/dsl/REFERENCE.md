# Blueprint DSL Reference

Your blueprint is a sandboxed Python program. It has no `import`, no file/network
access, and no access to `_`-prefixed names or attributes — just the building
primitives below, a safe `math` namespace, a seeded `rng`, and plain Python
control flow (`for`, `while`, `if`, `def`, list/dict comprehensions, etc).

Coordinates are integers, **y-up**: `x` and `z` are horizontal, `y` is vertical
(up is `+y`). Place your build starting near the origin `(0, 0, 0)`.

Blocks are given as bare name strings, e.g. `"oak_planks"`, `"stone_bricks"`,
`"glass"`. An unknown name raises an error with suggestions — fix the name and
resubmit.

Blocks can carry a **state** in `[key=value,...]` form for orientation and shape — this is
how you get real architectural detail. Stairs, slabs, walls, fences, fence gates, trapdoors,
doors and panes all render with their true geometry:

```python
set_block(3, 1, 0, "oak_stairs[facing=south,half=bottom,shape=straight]")
set_block(0, 2, 0, "oak_slab[type=top]")          # top half-slab
set_block(5, 1, 5, "cobblestone_wall")             # wall post + auto side arms
fill(0, 3, 0, 6, 3, 0, "spruce_trapdoor[facing=north,half=top,open=false]")  # eaves/awning
```

Common states: stairs — `facing=north|south|east|west, half=bottom|top, shape=straight|inner_left|inner_right|outer_left|outer_right`;
slabs — `type=bottom|top|double`; trapdoors/doors — `facing=..., half=..., open=true|false`.
Use stairs/slabs for rooflines and steps, walls/fences for railings, trapdoors for shutters
and trim — this is where believable detail comes from.

`"air"` is a valid block for carving/erasing. Unlike `clear()` (which only removes
cells from your local build and leaves whatever was already there on paste),
explicitly placing `"air"` (via `set_block`/`fill`/`set_blocks`) is written into the
exported `.schem` and actively clears/overwrites existing terrain at that position
when pasted with WorldEdit. Use `clear()` for build-local cleanup; place `"air"` when
you specifically want the build to cut into surrounding terrain (e.g. a doorway into
a hillside).

## Patching an existing build

When refining a build you already submitted, you have two incremental tools:

`str_replace` finds an exact, unique snippet of text in the blueprint source you've accumulated
so far and replaces it, then reruns the WHOLE patched source from scratch against an empty world.
Because it's the same one program, variables, helper functions, and transform contexts defined
elsewhere in the source stay intact — there is no persistence gap to worry about. Use it for
surgical fixes: change one `fill(...)` call's material, insert a line after an existing one, tweak
a coordinate. `old_str` must match exactly (whitespace included) and only once; if it matches zero
or multiple times, nothing changes and you get an error to retry with more context. Pass
`submit=false` to stage the text edit without building/rendering it (free — no edit budget spent),
so several str_replace calls can be batched before paying for one render; the batch's final call
should use `submit=true` (the default) to actually build the accumulated edits.

`edit_region([x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2], ...)` clears one bounding box and then runs a fresh code snippet
against the CURRENT (post-clear) voxel state, not a fresh world — write only what should appear in
that region (e.g. `fill(...)` a new room, place `'air'` to carve). Two things do NOT carry over
into that snippet: transform contexts (`with translate/mirror/rotate_y` are fresh each call) and
any Python variables or functions defined elsewhere (gone — talk to the grid only through
primitives). Use this for a wholesale redo of one region (e.g. the roof or one wing) without
disturbing the rest.

## Primitives

```python
set_block(x, y, z, block)
set_blocks(entries, block=None)                            # batch: entries are (x,y,z) or (x,y,z,name)
fill(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, block)                       # solid box, corners in any order
clear(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)                              # remove blocks in a box
get_block(x, y, z)                                         # block placed there so far, or None
hollow_box(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, block, thickness=1)      # box shell (all 6 sides)
walls(x1, z1, x2, z2, y1, y2, block, thickness=1)           # 4 vertical walls, no floor/ceiling
floor(x1, z1, x2, z2, y, block)                             # flat rectangular plate at height y
line(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, block)                         # 3D straight line

cylinder(cx, cz, y, height, r, block, hollow=False)         # vertical cylinder, base at y
sphere(cx, cy, cz, r, block, hollow=False)
dome(cx, cy, cz, r, block, hollow=False)                    # upper hemisphere, base at cy
pyramid(cx, cz, y, base, height, block, hollow=False)       # square pyramid, base at y
cone(cx, cz, y, r, height, block, hollow=False)             # circular cone, base at y

gable_roof(x1, z1, x2, z2, y, block, ridge_axis='x', overhang=1)  # A-frame roof
hip_roof(x1, z1, x2, z2, y, block, overhang=1)                     # 4-sided sloped roof
```

`get_block(x, y, z)` reads back whatever this program has placed at that cell so far (through
the same `translate`/`mirror`/`rotate_y` transforms `set_block` writes through), returning
`None` for a cell nothing has touched yet. Use it to make later code react to earlier code —
skip re-weathering a cell that's already cracked, only trim a wall where it's still the base
material, or check a neighbor before deciding what to place next:

```python
walls(0, 0, 8, 6, 0, 4, "cobblestone")
scatter(0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, "mossy_cobblestone", density=0.2)
for x in range(0, 9):
    for y in range(0, 5):
        if get_block(x, y, 0) == "cobblestone":   # skip cells scatter() already mossed
            set_block(x, y, 0, "cracked_stone_bricks" if (x + y) % 5 == 0 else "cobblestone")
```

## Detail helpers

Use these to break up flat, monotone surfaces — the difference between a blockout and a
finished build.

```python
weighted_block({name: weight, ...})   # a block "value" sampled per cell; pass it anywhere a
                                       # block is accepted, e.g. for weathering / texture variation
scatter(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, block, density=0.1)   # random sprinkle of block in a box
frame(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, block)                  # just the 12 edges of a box (trim/posts)
window_grid(x1, z1, x2, z2, y1, y2, block, spacing=2, margin=1)  # regular openings in an
                                                                 # axis-aligned wall plane
```

Example — a weathered stone-brick wall (70% clean, 20% cracked, 10% mossy):

```python
wall = weighted_block({"stone_bricks": 0.7, "cracked_stone_bricks": 0.2, "mossy_stone_bricks": 0.1})
walls(0, 0, 10, 6, 0, 5, wall)
```

## Transform contexts

Composable — nest them to build symmetric structures without recomputing coordinates:

```python
with translate(dx, dy, dz):
    ...                      # all coordinates inside are offset by (dx, dy, dz)

with mirror('x', at=5):
    ...                      # reflect the x coordinate about x=5 (also 'y', 'z')

with rotate_y(quarters):
    ...                      # rotate around the vertical axis by 90*quarters degrees
```

## Utilities

```python
math.sin/cos/tan/sqrt/floor/ceil/pi/tau/radians/degrees/atan2/hypot/pow/log/e
rng.randint(a, b) / rng.choice(seq) / rng.uniform(a, b) / rng.random()
```

## Worked examples

**Simple house shell with a gable roof:**

```python
walls(0, 0, 8, 6, 0, 4, "cobblestone", thickness=1)
floor(0, 0, 8, 6, 0, "oak_planks")
clear(3, 1, 0, 4, 3, 0)  # doorway
gable_roof(-1, -1, 9, 7, 5, "spruce_planks", ridge_axis="x", overhang=1)
```

**A tower with a domed cap:**

```python
cylinder(0, 0, 0, height=12, r=4, block="stone_bricks", hollow=True)
floor(-4, -4, 4, 4, 0, "stone_bricks")
dome(0, 12, 0, r=4, block="stone_bricks")
```

**Symmetric wings using `mirror`:**

```python
# central hall
fill(-2, 0, -2, 2, 3, 2, "quartz_block")
clear(-1, 1, -2, 1, 2, -2)

# one wing, mirrored to build the other automatically
def wing():
    fill(2, 0, -1, 6, 3, 1, "quartz_block")
    clear(2, 1, -0, 2, 2, 0)

wing()
with mirror('x', at=0):
    wing()
```

**Repeating a shape with a loop + `rotate_y`:**

```python
for i in range(4):
    with rotate_y(i):
        with translate(6, 0, 0):
            cylinder(0, 0, 0, height=6, r=1, block="cobblestone")  # 4 corner turrets
```

**Using `math` — items evenly around a circle (polar coordinates):**

`math` and `rng` are already available — no import. Here, glowstone posts are placed evenly
around a circular courtyard by converting an angle to (x, z) with `cos`/`sin`, collected into a
list, and placed in one `set_blocks` call:

```python
n = 8          # number of posts
r = 6          # courtyard radius
posts = [
    (round(r * math.cos(2 * math.pi * i / n)), 1, round(r * math.sin(2 * math.pi * i / n)), "glowstone")
    for i in range(n)
]
set_blocks(posts)
```

**Example: an asymmetric L-shaped cottage (only when the requested typology benefits from it).**

This example demonstrates the DSL syntax for offset masses and varied materials. It is NOT a
default design template. Never copy its footprint, roof system, or palette unless they fit the
user's requested building type. The user's requested silhouette and typology always take priority.

Vary massing, opening rhythm, and materials between faces when that serves the requested design:

```python
# main wing (long, low)
walls(0, 0, 9, 5, 0, 4, "cobblestone")
floor(0, 0, 9, 5, 0, "oak_planks")
# perpendicular wing, offset — makes the footprint an L, not a box
walls(6, 3, 10, 8, 0, 5, "cobblestone")
floor(6, 3, 10, 8, 0, "oak_planks")
# irregular window rhythm on the long face (not evenly spaced)
set_blocks([(0, 2, 2), (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 6)], block="glass")
# a single off-center door
clear(2, 1, 9, 3, 2, 9)
# weathered roofs in two materials so the wings read differently
gable_roof(-1, -1, 10, 6, 5, "spruce_planks", ridge_axis="x", overhang=1)
gable_roof(5, 2, 9, 11, 6, "dark_oak_planks", ridge_axis="z", overhang=1)
# a bit of moss on the north wall for age
scatter(0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 0, "mossy_cobblestone", density=0.15)
```

Guidance: use asymmetry and irregular footprints only when they fit the prompt. Do not turn a
tower, lighthouse, shrine, silo, keep, or other compact/axial typology into an L/T/cross-shaped
building just because an example above uses that form. Circular, square, radial, or strongly
symmetric massing is often correct for towers and similar structures. Treat every worked example
as syntax documentation, never as a design default. Use `weighted_block`/`scatter` only after
the requested primary massing, materials, roof, openings, and access are correct.

NOTE:
1. Do NOT use import statements — `math`, `rng`, and every primitive/transform listed above are
   already injected as ready-to-use globals; nothing in this DSL ever needs an import.
2. Do NOT call rng.seed. It has been pre-seeded for you.
